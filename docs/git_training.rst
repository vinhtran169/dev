Git Training
============

Git is a distributed version control systems (DVCS) which was used to manange all Teracy's
development resources. You need to learn to use Git to work with Teracy's projects.

Learn
-----

There are many free available resources for learning git. These are some of recommended resources
that you need to learn it.

- http://git-scm.com/book

- http://sixrevisions.com/resources/git-tutorials-beginners/

- http://documentup.com/skwp/git-workflows-book

Practice
--------

After learning, now it's the time for practice.

- Prerequisites

    + github account with configured ssh keys.

    + ``teracy-dev`` is running with working ssh (``$ ssh -T git@github.com`` should be ok).

- Git basics

    + You're going to create ``pro-git-practice`` repository on github (via github's web UI).

    + The repository on your VM should be at: ``workspace/personal/pro-git-practice``

    + Read the chapter 2 and practice with your ``pro-git-practice`` repository on your VM at
      http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics

    + Remember to push the changes to github so we could see your work and practice.


- Work again on teracy-tutorial

Note: You're encouraged to practice with as many git commands as possible, but have to follow
strictly all the instructions below, the results will be displayed on github to check.

As you remember, you practiced to adapt Django's tutorial into Teracy's Django boilerplate project.

Now you will work on it again with git and push it to github.

First, create a repository name ``teracy-tutorial`` on github, and setup the local repo
``workspace/personal/teracy-tutorial`` on your VM.

Push the first commit there on github (Initial setup).

#. Setup project layout

    - Add remote repository https://github.com/teracy-official/django-boilerplate.git into
      your repository with named ``djbp``.

    - Fetch and merge ``djbp/master`` branch.

    - Push the merge to your github's repository at ``origin/master``.

#. Tutorial 01 at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/

    - Create a branch named ``tutorial01``, branch off from ``origin/master``.

      branch, then push to ``origin/master`` branch.
