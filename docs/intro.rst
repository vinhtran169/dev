Introduction
============

Welcome to ``teracy-dev`` - the starting point to learn to join Teracy team.

We, Teraciers, believe that development experience is really important. That's why we care and make
sure our development environment must be consistent, smooth, and easy to setup. We don't have to
spend too much time for installing tons of development packages one by one, we want that setup
process must be automated.

And this ``teracy-dev`` repository was created for that purpose, to make sure working at Teracy with
ease and fun. We're going to use ``virtualbox`` for running isolated virtual machines, ``chef`` and
``vagrant`` for installing and configuring any necessary packages automatically.

We work intensively on this documentation so that anyone, who wants to join us, have to pass the
training program by following the documentation instructions. The documentation will guide you steps
by steps to setup working environment, to learn our toolchain, workflow, and our development
culture.

Why ``teracy`` name?
--------------------

tera- + racy = teracy /ˈtɛrəsɪ/. That's how I came up with this name.

The name could be understood as: "1,000,000,000,000 times of vigorous, lively, energetic,
entertaining, etc."

However, the actual meaning of this name will depend on all Teraciers to add and contribute
meanings to the name.
